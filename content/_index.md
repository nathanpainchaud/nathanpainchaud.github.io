        I'm a junior researcher working on applications of AI to healthcare data. I am mostly interested in how to combine the complex multimodal data, especially the rich imaging data, to improve disease characterization.

        From my background in computer science, I've also kept a strong interest in the technical side of things. I try my best to be active on GitHub and to contribute to the open-source projects that I use, either professionally or personally.

        Don't hesitate to reach out to collaborate 😃
