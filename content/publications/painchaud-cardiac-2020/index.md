abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had unprecedented success in medical
  imaging and, in particular, in medical image segmentation. However, despite the
  fact that segmentation results are closer than ever to the inter-expert variability,
  CNNs are not immune to producing anatomically inaccurate segmentations, even when
  built upon a shape prior. In this paper, we present a framework for producing cardiac
  image segmentation maps that are guaranteed to respect pre-defined anatomical criteria,
  while remaining within the inter-expert variability. The idea behind our method
  is to use a well-trained CNN, have it process cardiac images, identify the anatomically
  implausible results and warp these results toward the closest anatomically valid
  cardiac shape. This warping procedure is carried out with a constrained variational
  autoencoder (cVAE) trained to learn a representation of valid cardiac shapes through
  a smooth, yet constrained, latent space. With this cVAE, we can project any implausible
  shape into the cardiac latent space and steer it toward the closest correct shape.
  We tested our framework on short-axis MRI as well as apical two and four-chamber
  view ultrasound images, two modalities for which cardiac shapes are drastically
  different. With our method, CNNs can now produce results that are both within the
  inter-expert variability and always anatomically plausible without having to rely
  on a shape prior.
