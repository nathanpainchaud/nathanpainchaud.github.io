abstract: Multimodal data fusion has emerged as a key approach in recent years for enhancing
  diagnosis and prognosis in many medical applications. With the advent of transformer-based
  methods, it is now possible to combine information from different modalities that provide
  complementary insights. However, most existing methods rely on symmetric fusion schemes, assuming
  equal importance for information carried by each modality—a strong assumption that may not always
  hold true. In this study, we propose an alternative fusion strategy based on an asymmetric scheme.
  Starting with a primary modality that offers the most critical information, we integrate secondary
  modality contributions by disentangling shared and modality-specific information. The proposed
  model was validated on a dataset of 239 patients for characterizing hypertension severity by
  fusing time series automatically extracted from echocardiographic image sequences and tabular
  data from patient records. Results show that our approach outperforms existing unimodal and
  multimodal approaches, achieving an AUC score over 90% - a crucial benchmark for clinical use.
