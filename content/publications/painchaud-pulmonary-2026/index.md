abstract: Risk stratification for pulmonary embolism (PE) is critical for
  clinical decision-making. Stratification guidelines are based on patient
  medical records, parameters measured from computed tomography pulmonary
  angiography (CTPA), and blood tests. However, blood tests are often missing
  in routine practice. This work studies whether state-of-the-art models can
  accurately classify risk stratification from only medical records and
  biomarkers extracted from CTPA images. We benchmark different approaches to
  combine medical records and cardiac biomarkers with rich pulmonary vascular
  information; we add vascular biomarkers to tabular models and apply graph
  neural networks (GNNs) on the vascular tree's intrinsic graph representation.
  We use a private dataset (n=353) with uniquely complete data for PE risk
  stratification. Our results show that, among global features, medical records
  and cardiac biomarkers are the most significant predictors, while vascular
  biomarkers do not further improve stratification. Even more surprising, even
  GNNs on vascular graphs fail to outperform strong tabular baseline on global
  features. We consider hypotheses, on both models and data, that could explain
  this suboptimal performance. Our investigation suggests that, counter-intuitively,
  vascular graphs may not help predict PE guidelines risk better than simpler
  clinical biomarkers. Code is available from https://github.com/creatis-myriad/GENESIS.
