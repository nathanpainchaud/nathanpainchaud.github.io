abstract: In this paper, we explore a process called neural teleportation, a mathematical
  consequence of applying quiver representation theory to neural networks. Neural
  teleportation teleports a network to a new position in the weight space and preserves
  its function. This phenomenon comes directly from the definitions of representation
  theory applied to neural networks and it turns out to be a very simple operation
  that has remarkable properties. We shed light on the surprising and counter-intuitive
  consequences neural teleportation has on the loss landscape. In particular, we show
  that teleportation can be used to explore loss level curves, that it changes the
  local loss landscape, sharpens global minima and boosts back-propagated gradients
  at any moment during the learning process.
