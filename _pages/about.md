Ph.D. student in a cotutelle between [VITAL](https://vitalab.github.io/) at the **Université de Sherbrooke** (CA) and
[**CREATIS**](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7) in Lyon (FR).

My research interests are in **representation learning**, on the methodological side, and **cardiac imaging**, on the applications' side.

Outside of research, I'm into cycling, working out and cooking, all while listening to a wide range of music.
