In 2024, I obtained my Ph.D. in co-supervision between [VITAL](https://vitalab.github.io/), at the **Université de Sherbrooke** (CA),
and [**CREATIS**](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7), at **INSA Lyon** (FR), working on deep learning for analyzing healthcare data.
My specialties are in **representation learning** and **cardiac medical imaging**.

<!-- Outside of research, I'm into cycling, working out and cooking (especially pastries). -->
